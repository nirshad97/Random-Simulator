# Random-Simulator

This is a simple simulator which is created using python. This was inspired by one of the YouTube videos which I watched long time ago. Randomness may seem completely chaoic but within all the chaos which tend to overlook the beauty. This simulation works in a simple manner. We start with three points (which are constant points A,B,C) resembling the vertices of a tiangle and a 6 faced dice. We start by picking another point on the cartesian plane randomly. After this random point, we roll the dice. If we get 1 or 2, we move halfway towards point A. If we get 3 or 4, we move halfway towards B and if we get 5 or 6, we move halfway towards C. Each time, when we roll the dice we always start from the previous position.

## End Results look something similar to this!
